# One-Night Web Basics

Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one evening by editing code directly and seeing results immediately.

## How to run
- No setup or install needed.
- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click from the file explorer).
- Keep your text editor open so you can read the comments and tweak code.

## Suggested one-night schedule (about 3 hours)
1. **HTML basics (35 min):** Structure, semantic tags, forms. Edit the live card preview.
2. **CSS basics (40 min):** Selectors, box model, Flexbox. Move the sliders and dropdowns.
3. **JavaScript basics (45 min):** Variables, events, DOM updates, localStorage. Build the counter and todo list.
4. **Playground (40 min):** Combine everything to style and power a profile card.
5. **Review (10 min):** Reset progress if you want to practice again.

## What you'll learn
- HTML structure and semantic elements.
- CSS colors, spacing, box model, hover/focus states, and Flexbox layout.
- JavaScript variables, functions, loops, conditionals, DOM selection, events, and small state with `localStorage`.
- How HTML, CSS, and JS work together without any frameworks.

## Troubleshooting
- **Changes not showing?** Hard refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R) to clear cache.
- **Broken links?** Make sure you're opening files from inside the `one-night-web-basics` folder so relative paths stay correct.
- **localStorage disabled?** The site still works; progress just won't persist between refreshes.
